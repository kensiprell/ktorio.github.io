Ktor is divided into modules to allow fine-grained inclusion of dependencies based on the functionality required.
The typical Ktor application requires `ktor-server-core` and a corresponding engine, depending on whether it's self-hosted or using an Application Server. 

All artifacts in Ktor belong to the `io.ktor` group and are hosted on [Bintray](https://bintray.com/kotlin/ktor)

Ktor is split into several groups of modules:

* `ktor-server` contains modules that support running the Ktor Application with different engines: Netty, Jetty, Tomcat, and a generic servlet. It also contains a TestEngine for setting up application tests without starting the real server.
  * `ktor-server-core` is a core package where most of the application API and implementation is located .
  * `ktor-server-jetty` supports a deployed or embedded Jetty instance.
  * `ktor-server-netty` supports Netty in embedded mode.
  * `ktor-server-tomcat` supports Tomcat servers.
  * `ktor-server-servlet` is used by Jetty and Tomcat and allows it to run in a generic servlet container.
  * `ktor-server-test-host` allows running application tests faster without starting the full host .
* `ktor-features` groups modules for features that are optional and may not be required by every application .
  * `ktor-auth` provides support for different [authentication systems](/servers/features/authentication.html) like Basic, Digest, Forms, OAuth 1a and 2.
  * `ktor-auth-jwt` adds the ability to authenticate against [JWT](/servers/features/authentication/jwt.html).
  * `ktor-auth-ldap` adds the ability to authenticate against an [LDAP](/servers/features/authentication/ldap.html) instance.
  * `ktor-freemarker` integrates Ktor with [Freemarker templates](/servers/features/templates/freemarker.html).
  * `ktor-velocity` integrates Ktor with [Velocity templates](/servers/features/templates/velocity.html).
  * `ktor-gson` integrates with [Gson](/servers/features/content-negotiation/gson.html), adding JSON content negotiation.
  * `ktor-jackson` integrates with [Jackson](/servers/features/content-negotiation/jackson.html), adding JSON content negotiation.
  * `ktor-html-builder` integrates Ktor with [kotlinx.html builders](/servers/features/templates/html-dsl.html).
  * `ktor-locations` contains experimental support for [typed locations](/servers/features/locations.html).
  * `ktor-metrics` adds the ability to add some [metrics](/servers/features/metrics.html) to the server.
  * `ktor-server-sessions` adds the ability to use [stateful sessions stored on a server](/servers/features/sessions.html).
  * `ktor-websockets` provides support for [Websockets](/servers/features/websockets.html).
* `ktor-client` contains modules for [performing http requests](/clients/http-client.html).
  * `ktor-client-core` is a core package where most of the http HttpClient API is located.
  * `ktor-client-apache` adds support for the Apache asynchronous HttpClient.
  * `ktor-client-cio`  adds support for a pure Kotlin Corutine based I/O asynchronous HttpClient.
  * `ktor-client-jetty` adds support for Jetty's HTTP2Client.
  * `ktor-client-auth-basic` adds support for [authentication](/clients/http-client/features/basic-auth.html).
  * `ktor-client-json` adds support for [json content negotiation](/clients/http-client/features/json-feature.html).
* `ktor-network` includes [raw sockets](/servers/raw-sockets.html) for client/server and TCP/UDP.
  * `ktor-network-tls` contains TLS support for raw sockets.
