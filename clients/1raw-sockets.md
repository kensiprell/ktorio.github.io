Ktor supports Client Raw Sockets that allow you to connect, for example,
to a telnet server, or to write custom CIO (Coroutine I/O) clients to
connect to databases or your own servers using either binary or text protocols.

Since raw sockets apply to both clients and servers, 
the documentation is unified on the **[Raw Sockets](/servers/raw-sockets.html)** page
in the Server section.
