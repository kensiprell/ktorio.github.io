Ktor supports Client Raw Sockets that allow you to connect, for example, to a telnet server.
You can also write custom CIO (Coroutine I/O) clients to connect to databases or your own servers using either binary or text protocols.

Since raw sockets apply to both clients and servers, the documentation is combined on the **[Raw Sockets](/servers/raw-sockets.html)** page in the Server section.
