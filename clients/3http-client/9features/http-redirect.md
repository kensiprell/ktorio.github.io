By default, Ktor HTTP client doesn't follow redirections (except for Apache and configuring it), this feature
allows to follow `Location` redirects in a way that works with any HTTP engine. Its usage is pretty straightforward
and the only configurable property is the `maxJumps` (20 by default) that limits how many redirects are tried
before giving up (to prevent infinite redirects).

## Install

This feature is installed by default.

## Prevent installing

}
``` 

This feature is included in the core of the HttpClient so it is available always along the client.
