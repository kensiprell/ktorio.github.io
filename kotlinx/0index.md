Kotlin provides two killer features: multiplatform projects (including common projects) and coroutines. Multiplatform doesn't provide any special functionality; it only allows you to use the exposed APIs from each platform. Coroutine support is also provided at the language level.

These libraries expose a common standard API for multiplatform projects: exposing atomic operations working in all platforms, providing coroutine-aware asynchronous tools, and being able to serialize and deserialize from one platform to another.

Kotlinx.* (Kotlin eXtensions) libraries are OpenSource and you can find them at <https://github.com/Kotlin/>
