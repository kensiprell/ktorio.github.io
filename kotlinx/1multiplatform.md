Kotlin Multi-Platform Projects (also called Kotlin MPP)

Reference: <https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/multiplatform.html>

Starting with Kotlin 1.2 there is experimental multiplatform support. The idea behind it is the ability to write common code with a subset of common APIs available on all platforms. Kotlin also offers specific functionality per platform.

Multiplatform projects add a couple of new keywords, expect and actual:
* expect is available for common projects to define APIs that will be available in common projects but will have specific implementations per platform.
* actual is available for non-common projects (JVM, JS and Native) and must match the expect structure in each platform that will be supported.

Starting with Kotlin 1.3-M2 there is a new multiplatform project model that aims to allow much simpler multiplatform projects:
