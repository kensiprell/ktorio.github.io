Do you need to send a message from Native or JVM to JavaScript or over the network? 

Do you need to store a class in a file and retrieve it later? 

kotlinx.serialization allows you to do it.

kotlinx.serialization is OpenSource and you can find it on GitHub: <https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization>
